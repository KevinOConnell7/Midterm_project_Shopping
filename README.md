## What is the Application?

The application that I made is a shopping list. This shopping list allows you to keep a list of items and quantity of the item that you would want to buy from your grocery store. You can add items to the list, remove items from the list, and update items quanitity when they are on the list. I am someone who oftens goes to the grocery store without a list and this would be very helpful for me to use. 

## How to run Application?

Create Virtual Enviroment

`python -m venv venv`
